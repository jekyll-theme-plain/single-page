    <p>For single-page sites, there's little point in using Jekyll. You can just put a static HTML file, and it will be deployed as is. However, you can still use the <a href="https://github.com/jekyll-theme-plain/jekyll-theme-plain">Plain Jekyll theme</a> to avoid writing boilerplate.</p>
    <p>Your portfolio site will most likely have links to your social profiles, like this:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/">LinkedIn</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://twitter.com/">X</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
