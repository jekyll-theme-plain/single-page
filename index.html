    <p>For single-page sites, there's little point in using Jekyll.  You can just put a static HTML file and it will be deployed as is.  However, you can still use this <a href="https://github.com/jekyll-theme-plain/single-page">single-page</a> template of the <a href="https://github.com/jekyll-theme-plain/jekyll-theme-plain">Plain</a> Jekyll theme to avoid writing boilerplate.  If you want to publish more than one page, refer to the <a href="https://github.com/jekyll-theme-plain/blog">blog</a> template.</p>
    <p>Your portfolio site will most likely have links to your social profiles.  Here's a template:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/">LinkedIn</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://twitter.com/">X</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
